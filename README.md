### Technology Overview

* Next.js and React is the web framework to create re-usable components, and provides rendering on the server side, allowing for faster load times when switching between pages.
* TailwindCSS for styling

### Devices
* The app can be properly viewed on the desktop, iPad in landscape mode, and on mobile phones.

## Lessons Learned
* Getting used to the syntax for writing React code in JSX format.
* Writing components that can be re-used, and can have a parent/child relationship, as components can be expanded onto other components.
* Adapting the UI to fit various screensizes using TailwindCSS's utility classes. Important to keep a mobile-first design
* Learning about how React Hooks work with state management. Functions such as 'useState' and 'useEffect' allows for users to interact the website and update it without having to refresh the page.
* Next.js simplifies the routing and we don't have to rely on a seperate package such as React Router. Pages are folder based, meaning if I wanted to make a new page, I create a new folder with the name of that page and add a page.jsx file in it.
* More practice with using version control and Git such as commiting and pushing code.
